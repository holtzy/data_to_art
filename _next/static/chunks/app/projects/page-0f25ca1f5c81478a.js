Together with Alexandre Schortgen PhD candidate at INSEP and INRIA within the PerfAnalytics team, we later turned the data captured at the french Olympic Qualification Tournament into a new specie of roses : Rosa Pugilatu. More commonly known as the Glove Rose, it blossoms following an Olympic flowering cycle.
