          Florent is an information designer focused on geospatial and
          environmental data, working with Microsoft's AI For Good Lab. I love
          exploring the intersection of data and art, and turning complex and
          difficult topics into inviting visual experiences. I use 3D tools and
          photo editing techniques to achieve the natural textures and color
          palettes that define my graphic identity.

          Soha is a data visualisation designer that focuses on humanising data
          through data art. There is just something about data when it comes to
          real life events and figuring out a way to visualise it in a way that
          can tell a powerful story and provoke emotion that she is passionate
          about, especially figuring out how to do provoke an emotional reaction
          from the audience. We as human being are visual creatures and showing
          a spreadsheet of number doesnt tell a story that can tug at people's
          empathy level, instead the visual representation of that story does a
          better job.

          I come from the Jura mountains where I spent my childhood between
          forest trails and sports fields. After following a sports-study
          training in handball until the baccalaureate, I moved to Switzerland
          to study biomechanics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
          (EPFL) in Lausanne. During my studies, I passionately discovered the
          multiple facets of scientific outreach for the general public. In
          2020, I joined the French National Institute of Sport, Expertise, and
          Performance (INSEP) and its Medalability project as a data-scientist,
          analyzing international competition in preparation for the Paris 2024
          Games. At the same time, I devoted my free time to turning everyday
          tools into means of artistic expression. Passionate about detours and
          creation, I founded Oiiwa in 2024. From my digital adventure
          playground, I transform a digital raw material into a fun and
          intelligible form. Aimed at a wide range of audiences and whether
          intended for printed, digital or plastic media, my creations are new
          ways of interacting with data by making them tangible and interactive!

          I'm an information designer, but graphics sometimes canâ€™t touch me.
          Outside work, I explore feelings I canâ€™t always name. I started
          journaling, then began collecting data and making it visual. I create
          handmade pieces from personal data. Habits, memories, moods. Itâ€™s a
          slow, reflective process that helps me listen to myself. I move away
          from standard charts, experimenting with intuitive, expressive forms.
          My work sits between data, emotion and self-awareness.

          Alisa believes climate change to be the most critical challenge facing
          our world and sought to find a way to use her art to further efforts
          to bring awareness to the issue. She was attracted by the inherently
          aesthetic design elements of scientific charts and graphs, and
          intrigued by the idea of using art to give them dramatic effect.
