This is only used when PPR is disabled.\n * @param includeDynamicData - Whether to prefetch dynamic data, in addition to\n * static data. This is used by <Link prefetch={true}>.\n * @param onInvalidate - A callback that will be called when the prefetch cache\n * When called, it signals to the listener that the data associated with the\n * prefetch may have been invalidated from the cache. This is not a live\n * subscription â€” it's called at most once per `prefetch` call. The only\n * supported use case is to trigger a new prefetch inside the listener, if\n * desired. It also may be called even in cases where the associated data is\n * still cached. Prefetching is a poll-based (pull) operation, not an event-\n * based (push) one. Rather than subscribe to specific cache entries, you\n * occasionally poll the prefetch cache to check if anything is missing.\n */\nexport function prefetch(\n  href: string,\n  nextUrl: string | null,\n  treeAtTimeOfPrefetch: FlightRouterState,\n  includeDynamicData: boolean,\n  onInvalidate: null | (() => void)\n) {\n  const url = createPrefetchURL(href)\n  if (url === null) {\n    // This href should not be prefetched.\n    return\n  }\n  const cacheKey = createCacheKey(url.href, nextUrl)\n  schedulePrefetchTask(\n    cacheKey,\n    treeAtTimeOfPrefetch,\n    includeDynamicData,\n    PrefetchPriority.Default,\n    onInvalidate\n  )\n}\n"],"names":["prefetch","href","nextUrl","treeAtTimeOfPrefetch","includeDynamicData","onInvalidate","url","createPrefetchURL","cacheKey","createCacheKey","schedulePrefetchTask","PrefetchPriority","Default"],"mappings":";;;;+BA0BgBA;;;eAAAA;;;2BAzBkB;0BACH;2BACM;8BACJ;AAsB1B,SAASA,SACdC,IAAY,EACZC,OAAsB,EACtBC,oBAAuC,EACvCC,kBAA2B,EAC3BC,YAAiC;IAEjC,MAAMC,MAAMC,IAAAA,4BAAiB,EAACN;IAC9B,IAAIK,QAAQ,MAAM;QAChB,sCAAsC;QACtC;IACF;IACA,MAAME,WAAWC,IAAAA,wBAAc,EAACH,IAAIL,IAAI,EAAEC;IAC1CQ,IAAAA,+BAAoB,EAClBF,UACAL,sBACAC,oBACAO,8BAAgB,CAACC,OAAO,EACxBP;AAEJ","ignoreList":[0]}
